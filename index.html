          <p>At the beginning of this summer, I spent two weeks in Italy. Often times we passed by things that I wanted to know about, but I did not know their names to even look them up. Users take pictures of places, monuments and buildings while they are on vacation, they then submit those photos on the app. The app will give them the name of the place and a brief description. Then, users could navigate to YouTube videos that give a more adequate description of the place that you are looking at, almost like a tour of it. This could be used for a historical description of a piece of art or background on a location.</p>
